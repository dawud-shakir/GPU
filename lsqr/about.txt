LSQR: 

Least-squares QR

In linear algebra, QR factorization decomposes a matrix (A) into
the product of an Orthogonal matrix (Q) and an Upper triangular matrix (R) 
(A = QR). So, 'Q' stands for Orthogonal (columns are
unit vectors and mutually perpendicular), and 'R' stands
for Right triangular (upper triangular)
